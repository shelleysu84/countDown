The Countdown

A simple demo for date countdown built by jquery and boostrap. It cost 30 min set up the task and test debug for 10 min.

I choose these jquery for quick dom selection, boostrap for layout grid format and responsive view design.

The improvement I would make is break the counter watching after it reaches the final countdown.
